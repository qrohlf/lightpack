## TODO

- âœ… basic auth & login

- pack index
- pack editing
- landing page (just a screenshot of the app on some kind of nice mountain backdrop)
- pack dropdown (model it after Scout Maps' map dropdown)
- profile dropdown (maybe use https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives for popovers?)
- description display
- add "colorScheme" to packs table, and add user color editing
- weight conversions
- worn/consumable/baseweight calculations
- font pack (use https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto as fallback)
- emoji font
- settings interface
- have a peek at https://github.com/galenmaly/lighterpack/issues
